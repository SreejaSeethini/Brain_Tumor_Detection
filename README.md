# 🧠 Brain Tumor Detection using Machine Learning

Welcome to the **Brain Tumor Detection** project! This project uses cutting-edge machine learning techniques to detect brain tumors from MRI images. 💻🔬

## 🚀 Features

- **CNN Model**: Uses a Convolutional Neural Network to detect brain tumors from images.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieved over 90% accuracy on test data.
- **User-Friendly**: Simple and intuitive interface for medical practitioners.
- **Data Augmentation**: Robust model trained with augmented data to improve accuracy.

## 🗂️ Dataset

The dataset used consists of MRI images of brain tumors, divided into categories:
- 📂 Tumor Present
- 📂 No Tumor

## 📦 Installation

Follow these steps to get started:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/brain-tumor-detection.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd brain-tumor-detection
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 🧠 Model Architecture

The model uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to analyze MRI images and predict the presence of a brain tumor. Here's a high-level overview:
1. **Input Layer**: MRI Image (64x64 pixels)
2. **Conv Layers**: Extract features from images.
3. **Pooling Layers**: Reduce dimensionality.
4. **Dense Layers**: Fully connected layers to predict the final class (Tumor/No Tumor).

## 🖼️ Sample MRI Images

| Tumor Present | No Tumor |
| ------------- | -------- |
| ![Tumor](images/tumor.png) | ![No Tumor](images/no_tumor.png) |

## 🧑‍🔬 Usage

After installing the dependencies, you can run the model with:

```bash
python detect.py --image <path_to_mri_image>
```

## 🔬 How it Works

1. Upload an MRI image.
2. The model processes the image using a CNN.
3. A probability score for the presence of a tumor is displayed.

## 🎯 Results

- **Accuracy**: 92.5%
- **Precision**: 91.3%
- **Recall**: 90.7%
